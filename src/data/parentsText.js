    text: 'Discuss with your nanny any increase in pay, your own reduction in costs and the number of children you might take on. Hapu makes it easy to add more than one child, though you and your nanny may wish to limit to one. We give you the option of open places beyond one as you may find the perfect family who have two little ones. This means a greater reduction in costs for you and a higher increase in pay for your nanny.',

    title: 'Setting an hourly rate',
    text: 'You set the rate you want. And this may be more than half. It’s up to you to determine the amount you and your nanny want to see at the end of the week. You can take into account existing costs you’ve already incurred in employing your nanny, your home as the location and so on. Do what works for you and your nanny. Once set Hapu automatically calculates the weekly cost to be paid. You can also use our automated shared rates if you are open to taking on more than one additional child. Shared rates makes it easy to split costs.',

    title: 'Your weekly total and receiving funds',
    text: 'Your days are set as the days you’re employing your nanny. Hapu doesn’t work off a calendar and we don’t want to complicate things as you’re not running a business. You simply set the days that you currently employ your nanny. Setting your days combines with your hourly rate(s) and the number of hours you set to calculate the total cost per week for sharers. You enter your bank account as the receiver of funds and pay your nanny at the end of the week as you currently do.',

    title: 'Verification and qualifications',
    text: 'Hapu is essentially a parent to parent app with our goal to connect families and provide tools to manage payments and attendance for nanny share. In doing so we allow parents to perform their own due diligence in verifying qualifications and references. You must present to any sharing parents your nanny’s Working With Children Check (WWCC) and you can select in your share to present any educational qualifications, first aid and references.',
