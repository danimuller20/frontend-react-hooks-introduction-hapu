    text: 'Discuss with your employer their reduction in costs and what you’d like to charge sharers and the number of children you might take on, one might be ideal. However, you can set more than one available place giving your share the option to grow and increase your income further. There might just be the perfect family who have two little ones. And it’s always best to be open to possibilities. Hapu makes it easier to take payments and manage families so you never know where your share may go and what overall increase in income you might reach.',

    title: 'Setting an hourly rate',
    text: 'You set the rate you want. And this may be a higher rate than what you charge your host family. It’s up to you to determine the amount you want to see at the end of the week. You can set an attractive low rate that ultimately balances out when combined with the hours you set for a great day rate. You can also use our shared rate system that automatically reduces costs and increases your income if your share grows beyond one additional child.',

    title: 'Your weekly total and receiving funds',
    text: 'Your days are set as the days you’re employed by your family. Hapu doesn’t work off a calendar. You simply set the days that you’re currently employed. Setting your days combines then with your hourly rate(s) and the number of hours you set to calculate the total cost per week for sharers. In creating and managing the nanny share you have the option of entering your bank account or your employer’s as the receiver of funds. If you enter your employer’s account they will pay you as they currently do.',

    title: 'Verification and qualifications',
    text: 'Hapu is essentially a parent to parent app with our goal to connect families and provide tools to manage payments and attendance for nanny share. In doing so we allow parents to perform their own due diligence in verifying qualifications and references. You must present to any sharing parents your nanny’s Working With Children Check (WWCC) and you can select in your share to present any educational qualifications, first aid and references.',
